# London Temperature Forecasting

This project was conducted by Adam Cersosimo, Jibin Solomon, Owen Hovey, and Daniel Cersosimo

Roles:
Adam Cersosimo: Project Team Leader 
Jibin Solomon: EDA Specialist
Owen Hovey: Data Preprocessing Specialist
Daniel Cersosimo: Lead Data Scientist 

In my role as Lead Data Scientist, I spearheaded the following processes:
  • Designed and directed a collaborative data-based project to construct a time series model to forecast temperature in London
  
  • Determined a workload breakdown and delegated tasks based on factors such as group members’ strengths and the project deadline
  • Data Acquisition: Discovered and loaded a comprehensive dataset for weather in London from 1979 to 2021
  • Data Cleaning: Viewed the nature and extent of null values and outliers to understand how to handle them appropriately
  • Exploratory Data Analysis: Examined statistical properties, distributions, and correlations to uncover patterns such as seasonality
  • Time Series Modeling: Experimented with various techniques such as linear regression, ETS, and ARIMA before settling on a
  seasonal regression model with a low MSE as this captured the essence of the seasonal oscillations without overfitting the data.
  • Results: Generated a visualization depicting a forecast from this model with 68% and 95% confidence intervals displayed while
  detailing the overall process, results, and real-world implications in a detailed report paper and presentation to the class
